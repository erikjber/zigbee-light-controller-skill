A skill for Mycroft. Controls ikea trådfri lights.

## About
Controls ikea trådfri lights via zigbee and voice commands.
Since Mycroft has been discontinued this skill is probably not very useful. It might or might not work with OpenVoiceOS, but that has not been tested and will not be supported.

## Examples
* "Turn on the lights"
* "Turn off the lights"
* "Dim the lights"
* "Lights to max"
* "Lights to full"
* "Lights to medium"
* "Lights to low"
* "Lower the lights"
* "Increase brightness"
* "Lights off"
* "Lights on"
